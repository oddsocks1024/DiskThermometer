# Disk Thermometer
## Summary

Thermometer is a small command line program for the Amiga, which is capable of
reading the temperature of SCSI hard disks which have sensors. It supports all
three temperature readings which hard disks use: Current Temperature,
Reference Temperature, Most Recent Temperature Reading. 

Originally written under a custom licence, Disk Thermometer is now available under
the GPL v2, which supercedes any previous licencing.
